## Expression for pressure exerted by a gas


Consider a monoatomic gas of N molecules each having a mass m inside a cubical container of side _l_ as shown in the Figure 9.1 (a).
![Alt text](q2.png)


**Gas molecule Container**

**Figure 9.1** (a) Container of gas molecules  

![image](qr1.png)

The molecules of the gas are in random motion. They collide with each other and also with the walls of the container. As the collisions are elastic in nature, there is no loss of kinetic energy, but a change in momentum occurs.

The molecules of the gas exert pressure on the walls of the container due to collision on it. During each collision, the molecules impart certain momentum to the wall. Due to transfer of momentum, the walls experience a continuous force. The force experienced per unit area of the walls of the container determines the pressure exerted by the gas. It is essential to determine the total momentum transferred by the molecules in a short interval of time.

A molecule of mass m moving with a velocity $$(vec{v})$$
having components($$(v_x, v_y, v_z)$$)
 hits the right side wall. Since we have assumed that the collision is elastic, the particle rebounds with same speed and its x-component is reversed. This is shown in the Figure 9.1 (b). The components of velocity of the molecule after collision are ($$(-v_x, v_y, v_z)$$)
.

The x-component of momentum of the molecule before collision = $$(m \cdot v_x)$$

![Alt text](figure2.png)
**Figure 9.1** (b) Collision of a molecule with the wall

The x-component of momentum of the molecule after collision = −mvx

The change in momentum of the molecule in x direction =Final momentum – initial momentum = −_mvx_ −_mvx_ = −2_mvx_

According to law of conservation of linear momentum, the change in momentum of the wall = 2_mvx_

In x direction, the total momentum of the system before collision is equal to momentum of the molecule

$$((mv_x))$$since the momentum of the wall is zero. According to the law of conservation of momentum the total momentum of system after the collision must be equal to total momentum of system before collision. The momentum of the molecule (in x direction) after the collision is $$(-mv_x)$$
 and the momentum of the wall after the collision is $$(2mv_x)$$. So total momentum of the system after the collision is $$((2mv_x - mv_x) = mv_x)$$
 which is same as the total momentum of the system before collision.

**Note**

The number of molecules hitting the right side wall in a small interval of time $$(\Delta t)$$is calculated as follows.

The molecules within the distance of $$(v_x \Delta t)$$
 from the right side wall and moving towards the right will hit the wall in the time interval $$(\Delta t)$$. This is shown in the Figure 9.2. The number of molecules that will hit the right side wall in a time interval $$(\Delta t)$$ is equal to the product of volume $$((A v_x \Delta t))$$and number density of the molecules (_n_). Here _A_ is area of the wall and _n_ is number of molecules per unit volume $$([\frac{N}{V}])$$


 .

We have assumed that the number density is the same throughout the cube. 

![Alt text](image_8.png)



The number of molecules that hit the right side wall in a time interval ∆_t_

\= _n_ 2

_Avx_ ∆_t_ (9.1)

In the same interval of time ∆_t_, the total momentum transferred by the molecules

∆_p_ = _n_ 2

_Avx_ ∆_t_ × 2_mvx_ = _Av_2 _x_ _mn_∆_t_ (9.2)

From Newton’s second law, the change in momentum in a small interval of time gives rise to force.

The force exerted by the molecules on the wall (in magnitude)

$$[ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{nmAv_x^2}{\Delta t} ] $$
(9.3)

Pressure, P = force divided by the area of the wall

$$[ P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{nmv_x^2}{x} ]$$
 (9.4)

Since all the molecules are moving completely in random manner, they do not have same speed. So we can replace the term $$(v_x^2)$$by the average$$(\overline{v_x^2})$$ in equation (9.4)

Since all the molecules are moving completely in random manner, they do not have same speed. So we can replace the term _vx_

2 by the average _vx_ 2 in equation (9.4)


$$[ p = nm\overline{v^2x} ]$$
(9.5)

Since the gas is assumed to move in random direction, it has no preferred direction of motion (the effect of gravity on the molecules is neglected). It implies that the molecule has same average speed in all the

three direction. So, $$[ \overline{v_x^2} = \overline{v_y^2} = \overline{v_z^2} ]$$
. The mean square speed is written as

$$[ \overline{v^2} = \overline{v_x^2} +\overline{v_y^2} +\overline{v_z^2} =\overline{3v_x^2} ]$$

$$[\overline{v_x^2}=\frac{1}{3} \overline{v^2}  ]$$


Using this in equation (9.5), we get

$$[ P = \frac{1}{3}nm \overline{v^2} ]$$


or 

$$[ P = \frac{1}{3} \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{V} ]$$ (9.6)

as [$$(n = \frac{N}{V})$$]






The following inference can be made from the above equation. The pressure exerted by the molecules depends on

1. **Number density** _n N V_

\= . It implies that if the number density increases then pressure will increase. For example when we pump air inside the cycle tyre or car tyre essentially the number density increases and as a result the pressure increases.

2. **Mass of the molecule** Since the pressure arises due to momentum transfer to the wall, larger mass will have larger momentum for a fixed speed. As a result the pressure will increase.

3. Mean square speed For a fixed mass if we increase the speed, the average speed will also increase. As a result the pressure will increase.

For simplicity the cubical container is taken into consideration. The above result is true for any shape of the container as the area A does not appear in the final expression (9.6). Hence the pressure exerted by gas  

molecules on the wall is independent of area of the wall (A).

## Kinetic interpretation of temperature


To understand the microscopic origin of temperature in the same way,

Rewrite the equation (9.6)
$$[ P = \frac{1}{3}nm \overline{v^2} ]$$


$$[ P = \frac{1}{3} {Nm\overline{v^2} }]$$



(9.7)

Comparing the equation (9.7) with ideal gas equation _PV=NkT_,

$$[ NkT=\frac{1}{3} {Nm\overline{v^2}} ]$$

$$[ kT=\frac{1}{3} {m\overline{v^2}} ]$$


 (9.8)

Multiply the above equation by 3/2 on both sides,

$$[\frac{3}{2}kT=\frac{1}{2} {m\overline{v^2}} ]$$

R.H.S of the equation (9.9) is called average kinetic energy of a single molecule (_KE_).

The average kinetic energy per molecule

_KE_ = ∈ = 3

2 _kT_ (9.10)

Equation (9.9 ) implies that the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy per molecule of the gas.

Compare this with the definition of temperature studied in lower classes:

Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness!

**Note**

**Equation 9.10 is a very important result from kinetic theory of gas. We can infer the following from this equation.**

$$[
\frac{P}{n} = \frac{1}{3}m\overline{v^2}
]$$

1. The average kinetic energy of the molecule is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. The equation (9.9) gives the connection between the macroscopic world (temperature) to microscopic world (motion of molecules).

2. The average kinetic energy of each molecule depends only on the temperature of the gas, not on the mass of the molecule. In other words, if the temperature of an ideal gas is measured using a thermometer, the average kinetic energy of each molecule can be calculated without seeing the molecule through the naked eye.

By multiplying the total number of gas molecules with the average kinetic energy of each molecule, the internal energy of the gas is obtained.

Internal energy of an ideal gas $$(U = N \frac{mv^2}{2})$$.

By using equation (9.9):

$$[U = NkT = \frac{3}{2}kT]$$ (Equation 9.11)

From equation (9.11), we understand that the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on the absolute temperature and is independent of pressure and volume.

**EXAMPLE 9.1**

A football at 27°C has 0.5 moles of air molecules. Calculate the internal energy of air in the ball.

**Solution:**

The internal energy of an ideal gas $$(U = \frac{3}{2}NkT)$$.

The number of air molecules is given in terms of the number of moles, so rewrite the expression as follows:

$$[U = \frac{3}{2}\mu RT]$$

Since $$(Nk = \mu R)$$, where $$(\mu)$$ is the number of moles.

Gas constant $$(R = 8.31 \, J \, mol^{-1} \, K^{-1})$$

Temperature $$(T = 273 + 27 = 300 \, K)$$

$$[U = \frac{3}{2} \times 0.5 \times 8.31 \times 300 = 1869.75 \, J]$$

This is approximately equivalent to the kinetic energy of a man of 57 kg running with a speed of 8 m s$$(^{-1}).$$
## Relation between pressure and mean kinetic energy

**From earlier section, the internal energy of the gas is given by**

$$[U = NkT = \frac{3}{2}PV]$$

**The above equation can also be written as**

$$[U = \frac{3}{2}PV]$$

**since** $$(PV = NkT)$$

$$[P = \frac{2}{3}\frac{U}{V} = \frac{2}{3}u]$$ (Equation 9.12)

From Equation (9.12), we can state that the pressure of the gas is equal to two-thirds of internal energy per unit volume or internal energy density ($$(u = \frac{U}{V})$$).

Writing pressure in terms of mean kinetic energy density using Equation (9.6):

$$[P = \frac{1}{3}\rho\overline{v}\overline{v} = \frac{1}{3}2\rho\overline{KE}]$$

where $$(\rho = nm)$$ is the mass density (Note $$(n)$$ is number density).

Multiply and divide the right-hand side of Equation (9.13) by 2, we get

$$[P = \frac{\overline{v}\overline{v}}{2}\frac{2}{3}\rho = \frac{\overline{KE}}{2}\frac{2}{3}\rho]$$ (Equation 9.14)

$$[P = \frac{2}{3}\overline{KE}]$$

From Equation (9.14), pressure is equal to 2/3 of mean kinetic energy per unit volume.

## Some elementary deductions from kinetic theory of gases


**Boyle’s law:**
From equation (9.12), we know that $$(PV = \frac{2}{3}U).$$

But the internal energy of an ideal gas is equal to $$(N)$$ times the average kinetic energy ($$(varepsilon)$$) of each molecule.

$$[ U = N\varepsilon ]$$

For a fixed temperature, the average translational kinetic energy $$(varepsilon)$$ will remain constant. It implies that

$$[ PV = \frac{2}{3} N\varepsilon ]$$

Thus, $$(PV)$$ is constant.

Therefore, the pressure of a given gas is inversely proportional to its volume provided the temperature remains constant. This is Boyle’s Law.

**Charles’ law:**

From the equation (9.12), we get $$(PV = \frac{2}{3}U)$$.

For a fixed pressure, the volume of the gas is proportional to the internal energy of the gas or the average kinetic energy of the gas, and the average kinetic energy is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. It implies that

$$[ V \propto T \text{ or } V = kT ]$$

where $$( k )$$ is a constant.

This is Charles’ Law.


**Avogadro’s law:**

This law states that at constant temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules. For two different gases at the same temperature and pressure, according to kinetic theory of gases,  


From equation (9.6),

$$[ \frac{P_1N_1V_1}{m_1v_1} = \frac{P_2N_2V_2}{m_2v_2} = 1 ]$$

where $$( v_1^2 )$$ and $$( v_2^2 )$$ are the mean square speeds for two gases, and $$( N_1 )$$ and $$( N_2 )$$ are the number of gas molecules in two different gases.

At the same temperature, the average kinetic energy per molecule is the same for two gases,

$$[ \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 \quad (9.16) ]$$

Dividing equation (9.15) by equation (9.16), we get $$( \frac{N_1}{N_2} = 1 )$$.

This is Avogadro’s Law. It is sometimes referred to as Avogadro’s Hypothesis or Avogadro’s Principle.


## Root mean square speed (_vrms_)

Root mean square speed ($$(v_{\text{rms}})$$) is defined as the square root of the mean of the square of speeds of all molecules. It is denoted by $$(v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{v^2})$$.

Equation (9.8) can be rewritten as,

Mean square speed $$(v)$$ can be expressed as:

$$[v = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}} \quad (9.17)]$$

Root mean square speed,

$$[v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}} \quad (9.18)]$$

From equation (9.18), we infer the following:
(i) $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$ is directly proportional to the square root of the temperature and inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the molecule. At a given temperature, molecules of lighter mass move faster on average than molecules with heavier masses.

Example: Lighter molecules like hydrogen and helium have higher $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$ than heavier molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen at the same temperature.
(ii) Increasing the temperature will increase the root mean square speed of molecules.

We can also write $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$ in terms of the gas constant $$(R)$$. Equation (9.18) can be rewritten as follows:

$$[v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \quad (9.19)]$$

where $$(N_A)$$ is Avogadro's number.

Since $$(N_Ak = R)$$ and $$(N_Am = M)$$ (molar mass),

The root mean square speed or r.m.s speed:

$$[v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \quad (9.19)]$$

Equation (9.6) can also be written in terms of the rms speed:

$$[P \frac{N}{m}v_{\text{rms}} = \frac{1}{3} \quad (9.20)]$$

since $$(v^2_{\text{rms}} = \frac{2}{3}v^2)$$.

Root mean square speed is not the same as average speed. Average speed is 0.92 times the root mean square speed.

**Note**

Impact of _vrms_ in nature:

1\. **Moon has no atmosphere.** The escape speed of gases on the surface of Moon is much less than the root mean square speeds of gases due to low gravity. Due to this all the gases escape from the surface of the Moon.

2\. **No hydrogen in Earth’s atmosphere**. As the root mean square speed of hydrogen is much greater than that of nitrogen, it easily escapes from the earth’s atmosphere.

In fact, the presence of nonreactive nitrogen instead of highly combustible hydrogen deters many disastrous consequences.  

**EXAMPLE 9.2**

A room contains oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the ratio 3:1. The temperature of the room is 27°C. The molar mass of O₂ is 32 g mol⁻¹, and of H₂ is 2 g mol⁻¹. The value of the gas constant $$(R)$$ is 8.32 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹.

**_Calculate_**

(a) RMS speed of oxygen and hydrogen molecules

(b) Average kinetic energy per oxygen molecule and per hydrogen molecule

(c) Ratio of average kinetic energy of oxygen molecules and hydrogen molecules

**_Solution_**

(a) Absolute Temperature $$(T = 27°C = 27 + 273 = 300 K)$$.

Gas constant $$(R = 8.32 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹)$$

**For Oxygen molecule:**
Molar mass $$(M = 32 g = 32 × 10⁻³ kg mol⁻¹)$$

$$[v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{3 \times 8 \times 32 \times 300}{32 \times 10^{-3}}} \approx 483 \, m/s]$$

$$[v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{3 \times 8 \times 300}{32 \times 10^{-3}}} \approx 484 \, m/s]$$

**For Hydrogen molecule:**
Molar mass $$(M = 2 \times 10^{-3} kg mol^{-1})$$

$$[v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{3 \times 8 \times 32 \times 300}{2 \times 10^{-3}}} \approx 1934 \, m/s]$$

$$[v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{3 \times 8 \times 300}{2 \times 10^{-3}}} \approx 1935 \, m/s]$$

Note that the $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$ is inversely proportional to $$(M)$$, and the molar mass of oxygen is 16 times higher than the molar mass of hydrogen. It implies that the $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$ of hydrogen is 4 times greater than the $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$ of oxygen at the same temperature. $$(1934 \approx 4 \times 483)$$.

(b) The average kinetic energy per molecule is $$(\frac{3}{2}kT)$$. It depends only on the absolute temperature of the gas and is independent of the nature of molecules. Since both gas molecules are at the same temperature, they have the same average kinetic energy per molecule. $$(k)$$ is the Boltzmann constant.

$$[\frac{3}{2}kT = \frac{3}{2} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 300 = 6.21 \times 10^{-21} J]$$

(c) Average kinetic energy of total oxygen molecules = $$( \frac{3}{2}NkT )$$ where $$(N_o)$$ is the number of oxygen molecules in the room.

Average kinetic energy of total hydrogen molecules = $$( \frac{3}{2}NkT )$$ where $$(N_H)$$ is the number of hydrogen molecules in the room.

It is given that the number of oxygen molecules is 3 times more than the number of hydrogen molecules in the room. So the ratio of average kinetic energy of oxygen molecules to the average kinetic energy of hydrogen molecules is 3:1.

## Mean (or) average speed ($$(v)$$)

It is defined as the mean (or) average of all the speeds of molecules.

$$[ \bar{v} = \frac{v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + \ldots + v_N}{N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} v_i}{N} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} v_i \quad (9.20) ]$$

Here $$(M)$$ is the molar mass, and $$(m)$$ is the mass of the molecule.

$$[ \bar{v} = \frac{1}{60} \sqrt{\frac{kT}{m}} \quad (9.21) ]$$

**9.2.7. Most probable speed ($$(v_{\text{mp}})$$)**

It is defined as the speed acquired by most of the molecules of the gas.

$$[v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}} \quad (9.22)]$$

$$[v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{\pi m}} \quad (9.23)]$$

The derivation of equations (9.20), (9.22) is beyond the scope of this book.

**Comparison of $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$, $$(v)$$, and $$(v_{\text{mp}})$$:**

Among the speeds, $$(v_{\text{rms}})$$ is the largest and $$(v_{\text{mp}})$$ is the least.

$$[v_{\text{rms}} : \bar{v} : v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} : 1 : \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \approx 1.732 : 1 : 1.414 : \pi]$$

**EXAMPLE 9.3**

Ten particles are moving at speeds of 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, and 9 m/s. Calculate the RMS speed, average speed, and most probable speed.

**_Solution_**

The average speed:

$$[\bar{v} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} v_i}{10} = \frac{2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 9}{10} = 5.3 \, m/s]$$

To find the RMS speed, first calculate the mean square speed $$(v^2_{\text{rms}})$$:

$$[v^2_{\text{rms}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} v_i^2}{10} = \frac{2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 9^2}{10} = 34.9]$$

The RMS speed:

$$[v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{v^2_{\text{rms}}} = \sqrt{34.9} \approx 5.92 \, m/s]$$

The most probable speed is 5 m/s because three of the particles have that speed.

**EXAMPLE 9.4**

Calculate the RMS speed, average speed, and the most probable speed of 1 mole of hydrogen molecules at 300 K. Neglect the mass of the electron.

**_Solution_**

The hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron. The mass of the electron is negligible compared to the mass of the proton. Mass of one proton = $$(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, kg)$$. One hydrogen molecule = 2 hydrogen atoms = $$(2 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, kg)$$. The average speed:

$$[\bar{v} = \sqrt{\frac{16kT}{\pi m}} = \sqrt{\frac{16 \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 300}{\pi \times 2 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27}}} \approx 1720 \, m/s]$$

The RMS speed:

$$[v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \times 8 \times 300}{2 \times 10^{-3}}} \approx 1934 \, m/s]$$

Most probable speed:

$$[v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 300}{2 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27}}} \approx 1540 \, m/s]$$

Note that $$(v_{\text{rms}} > \bar{v} > v_{\text{mp}})$$.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Speed Distribution Function

In a classroom, the air molecules are moving in random directions. The speed of each molecule is not the same, even though macroscopic parameters like temperature and pressure are fixed. Each molecule collides with every other molecule, and they exchange their speed. In the previous section, we calculated the RMS speed of each molecule, and not the speed of each molecule, which is rather difficult. In this scenario, we can find the number of gas molecules that move with the speed of 5 m/s to 10 m/s or 10 m/s to 15 m/s, etc. In general, our interest is to find how many gas molecules have the range of speed from $(v)$ to $(v + dv)$. This is given by Maxwell’s speed distribution function.

$$[ N(v) \, dv = 4 \pi \left( \frac{M}{2 \pi kT} \right)^{3/2} v^2 e^{-\frac{Mv^2}{2kT}} \, dv \quad (9.24) ]$$

The above expression is graphically shown as follows:

![Figure 9.4](figure9.4.png)

**Figure 9.4** Maxwell distribution graph for two different temperatures.

Interestingly, once the gas molecule attains equilibrium, the number of molecules in the given range of speeds is fixed. For example, if a molecule initially moving with a speed of 12 m/s collides with some other molecule and changes its speed to 9 m/s, then the other molecule initially moving with a different speed reaches the speed of 12 m/s due to another collision. So in general, once the gas molecules attain equilibrium, the number of molecules that lie in the range of $$(v)$$ to $$(v + dv)$$ is always fixed.
