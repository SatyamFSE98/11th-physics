**BROWNIAN MOTION**

In 1827, Robert Brown, a botanist reported that grains of pollen suspended in a liquid move randomly from one place to other. The random (Zig - Zag path) motion of pollen suspended in a liquid is called Brownian motion. In fact, we can observe the dust particle in water moving in random directions. This discovery puzzled scientists for a long time. There were a lot of explanations for pollen or dust to move in random directions but none of these explanations were found adequate. After a systematic study, Wiener and Gouy proposed that Brownian motion is due to the bombardment of suspended particles by molecules of the surrounding fluid. But during the 19th century, people did not accept that every matter is made up of small atoms or molecules. In the year 1905, Einstein gave a systematic theory of Brownian motion based on kinetic theory and he deduced the average size of molecules.

According to kinetic theory, any particle suspended in a liquid or gas is continuously bombarded from all the directions so that the mean free path is almost negligible. This leads to the motion of the particles in a random and zigâ€“zag manner as shown in Figure 9.9. But when we put our hand in water it causes no random motion because the mass of our hand is so large that the momentum transferred by the molecular collision is not enough to move our hand.

**Brownian motion**

**Factors affecting Brownian Motion**

1. Brownian motion increases with increasing temperature.

2. Brownian motion decreases with bigger particle size, high viscosity, and density of the liquid (or) gas.

**EXAMPLE 9.6**

An oxygen molecule is traveling in air at 300 K and 1 atm, and the diameter of the oxygen molecule $$ (1.2 \times 10^{-10}) m. $$ Calculate the mean free path of the oxygen molecule.

**Solution:**
From equation (9.26), $$(lambda = \frac{2\pi d}{N})$$.

We have to find the number density \(n\). By using the ideal gas law,

$$
n = \frac{N}{V} = \frac{P}{kT}
$$

$$
n = \frac{101.31 \times 10^3}{1.381 \times 10^{-23} \times 300}
$$

$$
n \approx 2.449 \times 10^{25} \text{ molecules/m}^3
$$

$$
\lambda = \frac{2 \times \pi \times 1.2 \times 10^{-10}}{2.449 \times 10^{25}}
$$

$$
\lambda \approx 0.63 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
$$

- Kinetic theory explains the microscopic behavior of gases in terms of temperature, pressure.

- The pressure exerted on the walls of a gas container is due to the collisions of gas molecules on the walls.

$$
P = \frac{1}{3} \cdot n \cdot m \cdot \overline{v^2}
$$

The pressure is related to the mass of the molecule and the mean square speed.

- The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a molecule of the gas. The average kinetic energy is directly proportional to absolute temperature of gas and independent of the nature of molecules.

- The pressure is also equal to $$( \frac{2}{3} )$$ of the internal kinetic energy per unit volume.

- The rms speed of gas molecules: $$(v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}})$$

- The average speed of gas molecules: $$( \overline{v} = \frac{8}{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{kT}{m}} )$$

- The most probable speed of gas molecules: $$(v_{\text{mp}} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}})$$

- Among the speeds, $$(v_{\text{rms}}) $$is the largest and $$(v_{\text{mp}})$$is the least.

- The number of gas molecules in the range $$(v)$$ to $$(v + dv)$$ follows the Boltzmann distribution:

$$
N(v) \, dv = 4 \pi \left( \frac{m}{2 \pi kT} \right)^{3/2} v^2 e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}} \, dv
$$

- The minimum number of independent coordinates needed to specify the state and configuration of a thermodynamic system is known as the degrees of freedom of the system. If a sample of gas has $$(N)$$ molecules, then the total number of degrees of freedom $$(f)$$ is given by $$(f = 3N)$$. If there are $$(q)$$ number of constraints, then $$(f = 3N-q)$$.

- For a monoatomic molecule, $$(f = 3)$$. For a diatomic molecule (at normal temperatures), $$(f = 5)$$.
