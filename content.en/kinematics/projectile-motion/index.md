## Introduction
When an object is thrown in the air with some initial velocity (NOT just upwards), and then allowed to move under the action of gravity alone, the object is known as a projectile. The path followed by the particle is called its trajectory.
Examples of projectile are 
1. An object dropped from window of a moving train
2. A bullet fired from a rifle.
3. A ball thrown in any direction.
4. A javelin or shot put thrown by an athlete.
5. A jet of water issuing from a hole near the bottom of a water tank.

It is found that a projectile moves under the combined effect of two velocities.
(i) A uniform velocity in the horizontal direction, which will not change provided there is no air resistance.
(ii) A uniformly changing velocity (i.e., increasing or decreasing) in the vertical direction.

There are two types of projectile motion:
(i) Projectile given an initial velocity in the horizontal direction (horizontal projection)
(ii) Projectile given an initial velocity at an angle to the horizontal (angular projection)

To study the motion of a projectile, let us assume that,
(i) Air resistance is neglected.
(ii) The effect due to rotation of Earth and curvature of Earth is negligible.
(iii) The acceleration due to gravity is constant in magnitude and direction at all points of the motion of the projectile.

## Projectile in horizontal projection
Consider a projectile, say a ball, thrown horizontally with an initial velocity u from the top of a tower of height h (Figure 2.39).
As the ball moves, it covers a horizontal distance due to its uniform horizontal
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.39.png>)
velocity u, and a vertical downward distance because of constant acceleration due to gravity g. Thus, under the combined effect the ball moves along the path OPA. The motion is in a 2-dimensional plane. Let the ball take time t to reach the ground at point A, Then the horizontal distance
travelled by the ball is x (t) = x, and the vertical distance travelled is y (t) = y

We can apply the kinematic equations along the x direction and y direction separately. Since this is two-dimensional motion, the velocity will have both horizontal component u x and vertical component u y .

**Motion along horizontal direction** 
The particle has zero acceleration along x direction. So, the initial velocity u x remains constant throughout the motion.

The distance traveled by the projectile at a time t is given by the equation x = u x t + at 2.2 Since a = 0 along x direction, we have

Formula 

**Motion along downward direction**
Here u y = 0 (initial velocity has no downward component), a = g (we choose the +ve y-axis in downward direction), and distance y at time t

Formulas 
Substituting the value of t from equation (2.23) in equation (2.24) we have
Formulas 

Equation (2.25) is the equation of a parabola. Thus, the path followed by the projectile is a parabola (curve OPA in the Figure 2.39).
**(1) Time of Flight:** The time taken for the projectile to complete its trajectory or time taken by the projectile to hit the ground is called time of flight.
Consider the example of a tower and projectile. Let h be the height of a tower. Let T be the time taken by the projectile to hit the ground, after being thrown horizontally from the tower.
We know that s y = u y t + at 2 for vertical 2 motion. Here s y = h, t = T, u y = 0 (i.e., no initial vertical velocity). Then
Formulas 

Thus, the time of flight for projectile motion depends on the height of the tower, but is independent of the horizontal velocity of projection. If one ball falls vertically and another ball is projected horizontally with some velocity, both the balls will reach the bottom at the same time. This is illustrated in the Figure 2.40.
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.40.png>)
**Figure 2.40 Vertical distance covered by the two particles is same in equal intervals.**
(2) Horizontal range: The horizontal distance covered by the projectile from the foot of the tower to the point where the projectile hits the ground is called horizontal range. For horizontal motion, we have Formulas  Here, s x = R (range), u x = u, a = 0 (no horizontal acceleration) T is time of flight. Then horizontal range = uT. 2 h , we 
Since the time of flight T = g substitute this and we get the horizontal range of the particle as R = u 2 h g 
The above equation implies that the range R is directly proportional to the initial velocity u and inversely proportional to acceleration due to gravity g.
**(3) Resultant Velocity (Velocity of projectile at any time):** At any instant t, the projectile has velocity components along both x-axis and y-axis. The resultant of these two components gives the velocity of the projectile at that instant t, as shown in Figure 2.41
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.41.png>)
**Figure 2.41. Velocity resolved into two components**
The velocity component at any t along horizontal (x-axis) is v x = u x + a x t Since, u x = u, a x = 0 , we get
Formulas  
e component of velocity along vertical The direction (y-axis) is v y = u y + a y t
Formulas 
Hence the velocity of the particle at any instant is
Formulas 
The speed of the particle at any instant t is given by
Formulas 
**(4) Speed of the projectile when it hits the ground:** When the projectile hits the ground after initially thrown horizontally from the top of tower of height h, the time of flight i
Formulas 
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.42.png>)
## Projectile under an angular projection
This projectile motion takes place when the initial velocity is not horizontal, but at some angle with the vertical, as shown in
Figure 2.42.(Oblique projectile)
Examples:
- Water ejected out of a hose pipe held obliquely.
- Cannon fired in a battle ground.
Consider an object thrown with initial velocity u at an angle θ with the horizontal. Refer Figures 2.42 and 2.43.

Formulas 

where u x = u cos θ is the horizontal component and u y = usinθ the vertical component of velocity.Since the acceleration due to gravity is in the direction opposite to the direction of vertical component u y , this component will gradually reduce to zero at the maximum height of the projectile. At this maximum height, the same gravitational force will push the projectile to move downward and fall to the ground. There is no acceleration along the
x direction throughout the motion. So, the horizontal component of the velocity (u x = u cosθ) remains the same till the object reaches the ground.

Hence after the time t, the velocity along horizontal motion v x = u x + a x t = u x = u cos θ

The horizontal distance travelled by 1 projectile in time t is s x = u x t + a x t 2 2 Here, s x = x, u x = u cosθ, a x = 0

![Alt text](<../Fig 2.43.png>)

Formulas 
Here u y = u sinθ, a y = - g (acceleration due to gravity acts opposite to the motion). Thus

FOrmulas 
The vertical distance travelled by the 1 projectile in the same time t is s y = u y t + a y t 2 2 Here, s y = y, u y = u sinθ, a y = -g. Then
Formulas 
Substitute the value of t from equation (2.28) in equation (2.30), we have
Formulas 
**maximum vertical**
The maximum vertical distance travelled by the projectile during its journey is called maximum height. This is determined as follows:

Formulas 
Time of flight (T f ) The total time taken by the projectile from the point of projection till it hits the horizontal plane is called time of flight. 
This time of flight is the time taken by the projectile to go from point O to B via point A (Figure 2.43)1 
We know that s y = u y t + a y t 2
Here, s y = y = 0 (net displacement in y-direction is zero), u y = u sinθ, a y = -g, t = T f Then

Formulas 
**Horizontal range (R)**
The maximum horizontal distance between the point of projection and the point on the horizontal plane where the projectile hits the ground is called horizontal range (R).This is found easily since the horizontal component of initial velocity remains the same. We can write

Formulas 
The horizontal range directly depends on the initial speed (u) and the sine of angle of projection ( q ). It inversely depends on acceleration due to gravity ‘g’ For a given initial speed u, the maximum possible range is reached when sin2 q is maximum, sin2 q = 1. This implies 2 θ = π / 2

Formulas 
This means that if the particle is projected at 45 degrees with respect to horizontal, it attains maximum range, given by.

In Tamil Nadu there is an interesting traditional game ‘kitti pull’. When the ‘pull’ is hit by the kitti, the path followed by the pull is ‘parabolic’.

**Example 2.37**
Suppose an object is thrown with initial speed 10 m s -1 at an angle π/4 with the horizontal, what is the range covered? Suppose the same object is thrown similarly in the Moon,will there be any change in the range? If yes, what is the change?
_Solution_
In projectile motion, the range of particle is given by,
Formulas 
If the same object is thrown in the Moon, the range will increase because in the Moon, the acceleration due to gravity is smaller than g on Earth,
Formulas 
The range attained on the Moon is approximately six times that on Earth.
**Example 2.38**
In the cricket game, a batsman strikes the ball such that it moves with the speed 30 m s -1 at an angle 30 0 with the horizontal as shown in the figure. The boundary line of the cricket ground is located at a distance of 75 m from the batsman? Will the ball go for a six? (Neglect the air resistance and take acceleration due to gravity g = 10 m s -2 ).
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.38.png>)
_Solutions_
The motion of the cricket ball in air is essentially a projectile motion. As we have already seen, the range (horizontal distance) of the projectile motion is given by
Formulas 
The initial speed u 30 m s 1
The projection angle θ = 30 °
The horizontal distance travelled by the cricket ball
FOrmulas 
This distance is greater than the distance of the boundary line. Hence the ball will cross this line and go for a six.

## Introduction to Degrees and Radians
In measuring angles, there are several possible units used, but the most common units are degrees and radians. Radians are used in measuring area, volume, and circumference of circles and surface area of spheres.

Radian describes the planar angle subtended by a circular arc at the centre of a circle. It is defined as the length of the arc divided by the radius of the arc. One radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius of the circle. This is shown in the Figure 2.44.

![Alt text](<../Fig 2.44.png>)
**Figure 2.44 One radian (shown in yellow color)**
Degree is the unit of measurement which is used to determine the size of an angle.When an angle goes all the way around in a circle, the total angle covered is equivalent to 360°. Thus, a circle has 360°. In terms of radians, the full circle has π radian.2π radian.

Formulas 

**Example 2.39**
Calculate the angle q subtended by the two adjacent wooden spokes of a bullock cart wheel is shown in the figure. Express the angle in both radian and degree.
![Alt text](<../Ex 2.39.png>)
_Solution_
The full wheel subtends 2π radians at the centre of the wheel. The wheel is divided into 12 parts (arcs). So one part subtends an angle 2 π π θ = = radian at the centre 12 6 π Since, π rad = 180 ° , radian is equal 6 to 30 degree.The angle subtended by two adjacent wooden spokes is 30 degree at the centre.
**Note**
The number π plays a very important role in both physics and mathematics. It is an irrational number which cannot be expressed in finite decimal form. However, we can approximate π as ≈ 3.14 or 22/7 But we should not forget that is only an approximation to π and not equal to π.
## Angular displacement
Consider a particle revolving around a point O in a circle of radius r (Figure 2.45). Let the position of the particle at time t = 0 be A and after time t, its position is B.
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.45.png>)
Then The angle described by the particle about the axis of rotation (or centre O) in a given time is called angular displacement.
The unit of angular displacement is radian
The angular displacement (θ) in radian is related to arc length S (AB) and radius r as

Formulas 

**Angular velocity ( ω )**
The rate of change of angular displacement is called angular velocity. 
If θ is the angular displacement in time t, then the angular velocity ω is

Formulas 
The unit of angular velocity is radian per second (rad s -1 ). The direction of angular velocity is along the axis of rotation following the right hand rule. This is shown in Figure 2.46.
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.46.png>)
**i) Angular acceleration (α)**
The rate of change of angular velocity is called angular acceleration.The angular acceleration is also a vector quantity which need not be in the same direction as angular velocity.
**Tangential acceleration**
Consider an object moving along a circle of radius r. In a time ∆t, the object travels an arc distance ∆s as shown in Figure 2.47. The corresponding angle subtended is Δθ
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.46-1.png>)
**Figure 2.47 Circular motion**
The Δs can be written in terms of Δθ as,
Formulas
In a time ∆ t , we have
Formulas 
In the limit ∆t → 0, the above equation becomes
Formulas 
tangential to the circle and ω is angular speed. So equation (2.37) becomes
Formulas 
which gives the relation between linear speed and angular speed. 

---
**Note**
The direction of linear velocity v is tangential to the circle, whereas the direction of angular velocity ω is along the axis of rotation. The radius is also representedas a vector r directed radially from the centre of the circle.

---
Equation (2.38) is true only for circular motion. In general the relation between linear and angular velocity is given by
Formulas 
For circular motion equation (2.39) reduces to equation (2.38) since ω and r are perpendicular to each other.
Differentiating the equation (2.38) with respect to time, we get (since r is constant)
Formulas 
s the tangential acceleration d and is denoted as a t is the angular dt acceleration α . Then eqn. (2.39) becomes
FOrmulas 
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.48.png>)
## Circular Motion
When a point object is moving on a circular path with a constant speed, it covers equal distances on the circumference of the circle in equal intervals of time. Then the object is said to be in uniform circular motion. This is shown in Figure 2.49.
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.49.png>)
**Figure 2.49 Uniform circular motion**
In uniform circular motion, the velocity is always changing but speed remains the same. Physically it implies that magnitude of velocity vector remains constant and only the direction changes continuously.

If the velocity changes in both speed and
direction during the circular motion, we get
non uniform circular motion.
**Centripetal acceleration**
As seen already, in uniform circular motion the velocity vector turns continuously without changing its magnitude (speed), as shown in Figure 2.50.
![Alt text](<../FIg 2.50.png>)
**Figure 2.50 Velocity in uniform circular motion**
Note that the length of the velocity vector (blue) is not changed during the motion, implying that the speed remains constant. Even though the velocity is tangential at every point in the circle, the acceleration is acting towards the centre of the circle. This is called centripetal acceleration. It always points towards the centre of the circle. This is shown in the Figure 2.51.
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.51.png>)
**Figure 2.51 Centripetal acceleration**
The centripetal acceleration is derived from a simple geometrical relationship between position and velocity vectors (Figure 2.48 or Figure 2.52)
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.52.png>)
**Figure 2.52 Geometrical relationship between the postion and velocity vectors**
Let the directions of position and velocity vectors shift through the same angle q in a small interval of time Dt, as shown in Figure r r = r 2 2.52. For uniform circular motion, = 1 and = v = v 2 . If the particle moves from 1 position vector r 1 to r 2 , the displacement is given by ∆ r = r 2 − r 1 and the change in velocity from v 1 to v 2 is given by ∆ v = v 2 − v 1 .
The magnitudes of the displacement Δr and of Δv satisfy the following relation
Formulas 
Here the negative sign implies that Δv points radially inward, towards the centre of the circle.
Formulas 
For uniform circular motion v = ω r ,where ω is the angular velocity of the particle about the centre. Then the centripetal
acceleration can be written as
a = −ω 2 r

---
**Note**
The magnitude of centripetal acceleration is constant for uniform circular motion. But centripetal acceleration is not constant, but takes different directions during the motion.

---
**Non uniform circular motion**
If the speed of the object in circular motion is not constant, then we have non-uniform circular motion. For example, when the bob attached to a string moves in vertical circle, the speed of the bob is not the same at all time. Whenever the speed is not same in circular motion, the particle will have both centripetal and tangential acceleration as shown in the Figure 2.53.
![Alt text](<../Fig 2.53.png>)
**Figure 2.53 Resultant acceleration (a R ) in non uniform circular motion**
The resultant acceleration is obtained by vector sum of centripetal and tangential acceleration.
Since centripetal acceleration is , the r magnitude of this resultant acceleration is 2 v 2 given by a R = a +   .r2t This resultant acceleration makes an angle q with the radius vector as shown in Figure 2.53. This angle is given by tan θ = t 2 .( v r )
**Example 2.40**
A particle moves in a circle of radius 10 m.Its linear speed is given by v = 3 t where t is in second and v is in m s -1 .(
a) Find the centripetal and tangential acceleration at t = 2 s.
(b) Calculate the angle between the resultant acceleration and the radius vector.
_Solution_
The linear speed at t = 2 s
Formulas 
The centripetal acceleration at t = 2 s is
Formulas 
The tangential acceleration is a t = dv = 3 m s − 2 dt The angle between the radius vector with resultant acceleration is given by
Formulas

Are we moving with the same speed both day and night with respect to Sun? 

Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical orbit. Let us specify the velocity of the centre of Earth with respect to Sun as v c . This v c is due to the elliptical motion of the Earth around the Sun. We know that at the same time Earth is also spinning on its own axis. Due to this spinning, all objects on the surface of the Earth undergoes circular motion with velocity ( v s ) with respect to the axis of rotation of the Earth. At night both v c and v s are either in the same direction or at an acute angle with each other. So, the velocity of an object on the surface of Earth with respect to Sun at night time is v night = v c + v s . 

During the day v c and v s are either in opposite directions or at an obtuse angle with each other. So, the velocity of the object with respect to Sun at day time v day = v c − v s . From this, we can conclude that any object on the surface of the Earth travels faster with respect to Sun during night than during day time. This happens due to the rotation of the Earth.

Kinematic Equations of circular motion If an object is in circular motion with constant angular acceleration α, we can derive kinematic equations for this motion, analogous to those for linear motion. 

Let us consider a particle executing circular motion with initial angular velocity ω 0 . After a time interval t it attains a final angular velocity ω . During this time, it covers an angular displacement q . Because of the change in angular velocity there is an angular acceleration α .

The kinematic equations for circular motion are easily written by following the kinematic equations for linear motion in section 2.4.3

The linear displacement (s) is replaced by the angular displacement ( θ ) .

The velocity (v) is replaced by angular velocity ( ω ).The acceleration (a) is replaced by
angular acceleration ( α ).
The initial velocity (u) is replaced by the initial angular velocity ( ω 0 ).
By following this convention, kinematic equations for circular motion are as in the table given below.

---
**Note**
Kinematic equations for linear motion are applicable for only constant acceleration. Similarly kinematic equations for angular
motion are applicable to only constant angular acceleration.

---
**Example 2.41**
A particle is in circular motion with an acceleration α = 0 . 2 rad s − 2
(a) What is the angular displacement made by the particle after 5 s?
(b) What is the angular velocity at t = 5 s?. Assume the initial angular velocity is zero.
_Solutions_
Since the initial angular velocity is zero ( ω 0 = 0 ).
The angular displacement made by the particle is given by
Formulas
