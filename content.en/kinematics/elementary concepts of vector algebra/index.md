# ELEMENTARY CONCEPTS OF VECTOR ALGEBRA

In physics, some quantities possess only magnitude and some quantities possess both magnitude and direction. To understand these physical quantities, it is very important to know the properties of vectors and scalars.

**Scalar** 

It is a property which can be described only by magnitude. In physics a number of quantities can be described by scalars.

**Examples** 

Distance, mass, temperature, speed and energy.

**Vector** 

It is a quantity which is described by both magnitude and direction. Geometrically a vector is a directed line segment which is shown in Figure 2.10. In physics certain quantities can be described only by vectors.

**Examples** Force, velocity, displacement, position vector, acceleration, linear momentum and angular momentum.  

## Magnitude of a Vector

The length of a vector is called magnitude of the vector. It is always a positive quantity. Sometimes the magnitude of a vector is also called ‘norm’ of the vector. For a vector _A_, the magnitude or norm is denoted by
|_A_| or simply ‘_A_’ (Figure 2.11).

**Figure 2.11 Magnitude of a vector**

## Different types of Vectors

1. **Equal vectors:** Two vectors   _A_ and _B_ are said to be equal when they have equal magnitude and same direction and represent the same physical quantity (Figure 2.12.).
![Alt text](<../fig 2.12.png>)
**Figure 2.12 Geometrical representation of equal vectors**

**(a)Collinear vectors**: Collinear vectors are those which act along the same line. The angle between them can be 0° or 180°.

**(i) Parallel Vectors**: 

If two vectors _A_ and _B_ act in the same direction along the same line or on parallel lines, then the angle between them is 00 (Figure 2.13).
![Alt text](<../fig 2.13.png>)
**Figure 2.13 Geometrical representation of parallel vectors**

**(ii) Anti–parallel vectors:** 

Two vectors _A_ and _B_ are said to be anti–parallel when they are in opposite directions along the same line or on parallel lines. Then the angle between them is 1800 (Figure 2.14).
![Alt text](<../fig 2.14.png>)
**Figure 2.14 Geometrical representation of anti– parallel vectors.**

2. **Unit vector**: A vector divided by its magnitude is a unit vector. The unit vector for ˆ_A is denoted by A_ is denoted by ˆ_A is denoted by A_ (read as A cap or A hat). It has a magnitude equal to unity or one.

FORMULA
Thus, we can say that the unit vector specifies only the direction of the vector quantity.

**3. Orthogonal unit vectors:** Let i, j and k be three unit vectors which specify the directions along positive _x_–axis, positive  _y–_axis and positive _z_–axis respectively. These three unit vectors are directed perpendicular to each other, the angle between any two of them is 90°. ˆ,̂ ˆ_i j and k_ a ˆ_j and k_ are examples of orthogonal vectors.Two vectors which are perpendicular to each other are called orthogonal vectors as is shown in the Figure 2.15

**Figure 2.15 Orthogonal unit vectors**

## Addition of Vectors

Since vectors have both magnitude and direction they cannot be added by the method of ordinary algebra. Thus, vectors can be added geometrically or analytically using certain rules called ‘vector algebra’. In order to find the sum (resultant) of two vectors, which are inclined to each other, we use (i) Triangular law of addition method or (ii) Parallelogram law of vectors.

**Triangular Law of addition method** 

Let us consider two vectors _A and B_ as shown in Figure 2.16. 
![Alt text](<../fig 2.16.png>)
**figure 2.16 Head And Tail Of The Vectors**

To find the resultant of the two vectors we apply the triangular law of addition as follows:

Represent the vectors _A and B_ and by the two adjacent sides of a triangle taken in the same order. Then the resultant is given by the third side of the triangle taken in the reverse order as shown in Figure 2.17.

![Alt text](<../fig 2.17.png>)
**Figure 2.17 Triangle law of addition**

To explain further, the head of the first vector _A_ is connected to the tail of the second vector _B_ . Let θ be the angle between _A B_ and . Then _R_ is the resultant vector connecting the tail of the first vector _A_ to the head of the second vector _B_. The magnitude of _R_ (resultant) is given geometrically by the length of _R_ (OQ) and the direction of the resultant vector is the angle between _R_ and _A_ . Thus we write R = A + B .

**(1) Magnitude of resultant vector** The magnitude and angle of the resultant vector are determined as follows.

From Figure 2.18, consider the triangle ABN, which is obtained by extending the side OA to ON. ABN is a right angled triangle.

which is the magnitude of the resultant of _A and B_ 

**(2) Direction of resultant vectors:** If θ is the angle between A and  B, then

|_A+ B| A B AB_\+ = + +2 2 2 cosθ (2.1)

If 

_R_ makes an angle α with 

_A_ , then in ∆OBN,

tanα = _BN / ON_ = _BN / OA + AN_
tanα = Bsin / A+Bcos
⇒ α =  tan − 1 (B sin θ/ A + B cos θ )

**EXAMPLE 2.1**

Two vectors A and B of magnitude 5 units and 7 units respectively make an angle 60° with each other as shown below. Find the magnitude of the resultant vector and its direction with respect to the vector

**_Solution_**

By following the law of triangular addition, the resultant vector is given by

_R =  A + B_

**Note**
Another method to determine the resultant and angle of resultant of two vectors is the Parallelogram Law of vector addition method. It is given in appendix 2.1

## Subtraction of vectors

Since vectors have both magnitude and direction two vectors cannot be subtracted from each other by the method of ordinary algebra. Thus, this subtraction can be done either geometrically or analytically. We shall now discuss subtraction of two vectors geometrically using the Figure 2.19

For two non-zero vectors _A_ and _B_ which are inclined to each other at an angle θ, the difference _A - B_ is obtained as follows. First obtain _A B_− as in Figure 2.19. The angle between _A and B_ is 180–θ.
![Alt text](<../fig 2.19.png>)

**Figure 2.19 Subtraction of vectors**

The difference _A - B_− is the same as the resultant of _A_ and B_. We can write _A - B = A + (- B_) and using the equation (2.1), we have
FORMULa

Since, cos cos180 −( ) = −θ θ , we get

FORMULA

Again from the Figure 2.19, and using an equation similar to equation (2.2) we have

FORMULA

But sin sin cos180 180° −( ) = ° −( ) =θ θ θ and hence we get

FORMULA 

Thus the difference  

_A B_− is a vector with magnitude and direction given by equations 2.4 and 2.6 respectively.

**EXAMPLE 2.2**

Two vectors _A_ and _B_ of magnitude 5 units and 7 units make an angle 60° with each other. Find the magnitude of the difference vector _A - B_ and its direction with respect to the vector _A_.

**_Solution_**

Using the equation (2.4),

FORMULAS 

The angle that  

_A - B_− makes with the vector _A_ is given by
