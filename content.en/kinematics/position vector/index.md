# POSITION VECTOR

It is a vector which denotes the position of a particle at any instant of time, with respect to some reference frame or coordinate system.

The position vector r of the particle at a point P is given by

where x, y and z are components of _r_, Figure 2.25 shows the position vector _r_

**EXAMPLE 2.13**

Determine the position vectors for the following particles which are located at points P, Q, R, S.

**_Solution_**

The position vector for the point P is

The position vector for the point Q is

The position vector for the point R is

The position vector for the point S is

**EXAMPLE 2.14**

A person initially at rest starts to walk 2 m towards north, then 1 m towards east, then 5 m towards south and then 3 m towards west. What is the position vector of the person at the end of the trip?

**_Solution_**

As shown in the Figure, the positive x axis is taken as east direction, positive y direction is taken as north.

After the trip, the person reaches the point P whose position vector given by

Foumulas 

The displacement direction is south west.
