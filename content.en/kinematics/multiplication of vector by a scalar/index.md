# MULTIPLICATION OF VECTOR BY A SCALAR


A vector _A_ multiplied by a scalar λ results in another vector, λ_A_. If λ is a positive number then λ_A_ is also in the direction of _A_. If λ is a negative number, λ_A_ is in the opposite direction to the vector _A_.

**EXAMPLE 2.5**

Given the vector _A = 2i + 3j_, what is 3 _A_?

**_Solution_**

FORMULAS 

The vector 3 _A_ is in the same direction as vector _A_.

**EXAMPLE 2.6**

A vector _A_ is given as in the following Figure. Find 4A  and − 4A 

**_Solution_**

FORMULAS 

In physics, certain vector quantities can be defined as a scalar times another vector quantity.

**For example** 

1) Force

F = ma . Here mass ‘m’ is a scalar, and _a_ is the acceleration. Since ‘m’ is always a positive scalar, the direction of force is always in the direction of acceleration.

2 Linear momentum P = m / v . Here _v_ is the velocity. The direction of linear momentum is also in the direction of velocity.

3) Force F = qE , Here the electric charge ‘q’ is a scalar, and _E_ is the electric field. Since charge can be positive or negative, the direction of force _F_ is correspondingly either in the direction of _E_ or opposite to the direction of _E_ .

## Scalar Product of Two Vectors

**Definition** 

The scalar product (or dot product) of two vectors is defined as the product of the magnitudes of both the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.

Thus if there are two vectors _A and B_ having an angle θ between them, then their scalar product is defined as _A.B = AB_⋅cosθ. Here, _A B_ and are magnitudes of _A and B_ 

**Properties** 

(i) The product quantity _A . B_⋅ is always a scalar. It is positive if the angle between the vectors is acute (i.e., θ < 90°) and negative if the angle between them is obtuse (i.e. 90°<θ< 180°).

(ii) The scalar product is commutative, i.e._A.B= B.A_.  

(iii) The vectors obey distributive law i.e. _A (B+C) = (A + B)(A + C)

(iv) The angle between the vectors
θ = cos–1[A.B / AB]

(v) The scalar product of two vectors will be maximum when cos θ = 1, i.e. θ = 0°, i.e., when the vectors are parallel;
(A . B ) max = AB

(vi) The scalar product of two vectors will be minimum, when cos θ = –1, i.e. θ = 180°
(A . B) min = –AB, when the vectors are anti-parallel.

(vii) If two vectors _A_ and _B_ are perpendicular to each other then their scalar product _A . B_ = 0 , because cos 90°=0. Then the vectors _A_ and _B_ are said to be mutually orthogonal.

(viii) The scalar product of a vector with itself is termed as self–dot product and is given by
(A)^2 = A . A = AA cos θ = A2
Here angle θ = 0°
The magnitude or norm of the vector _A_ is

(xi) In terms of components the scalar product of _A and B_ can be written as

The magnitude of vector |_A_| is given by

**_Solution_**

![Alt text](<../FIG 2.22.png>)
Hence _A B_ and are not orthogonal to each other. _C D_. = − =10 10 0  Hence, _C D_ and are orthogonal to each other.

It is also possible to geometrically show that the vectors _C and D_ are orthogonal to each other. This is shown in the following Figure.
FORMULAS 

In physics, the work done by a force _F_ to move an object through a small displacement _dr_ is defined as,

FORMULAS 

The work done is basically a scalar product between the force vector and the displacement vector. Apart from work done, there are other physical quantities which are also defined through scalar products.

**Note**
In uniform circular motion,the centripetal force is perpendicular to the displacement. Hence, work done by this force is zero.

## The Vector Product of Two Vectors

**Definition** 

_The vector product or cross product of two vectors is defined as another vector having a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of two vectors and the sine of the angle between them. The direction of the product vector is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors, in accordance with the right hand screw rule or right hand thumb rule_ (Figure 2.22)_._

Thus, if A and B are two vectors, then their vector product is written as A × B which is a vector C defined by

C = A × B = (AB sin θ)n̂

The direction n̂ of A × B , i.e., C is perpendicular to the plane containing

**Figure 2.22 Vector product of two**

**_VECTOR PRODUCT (“CR_**

The vector product of _A_ and _B_ and is in the sense of advancement of a right handed screw rotated from A (first vector) to  B (second vector) through the smaller angle between them. Thus, if a right-handed screw whose axis is perpendicular to the plane formed by A and B,is rotated from A to B through the smaller angle between them, then the direction of advancement of the screw gives the direction of A × B i.e. C which is illustrated in Figure 2.22.

**Note**

According to Right Hand Rule, if the curvature of the fingers of the right hand represents the sense of rotation of the object, then the thumb, held perpendicular to the curvature of the fingers, represents the direction of the resultant _C_

**Properties of vector (cross) product.** 

(i) The vector product of any two vectors is always another vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing these two vectors, i.e., orthogonal to both the vectors A and B, even though the vectors A and B may or may not be mutually orthogonal.

(ii) The vector product of two vectors is not commutative, i.e.,A × B ≠ B × A But., |A × B |= [B × A] 
Here it is worthwhile to note that |A × B| = |B × A| = ABsin θ i.e., in the case of the product vectors A B× and B × A, the magnitudes are equal but directions are opposite to each other.

(iii) The vector product of two vectors will have maximum magnitude when sin θ = 1, i.e., θ = 90° i.e., when the vectors _A_ and _B_ are orthogonal to each other.
_(A × B)max= ABn_

(iv) The vector product of two non–zero vectors will be minimum when sin|θ| = θ i.e or_0 = 00 180
i.e., the vector product of two non–zero vectors vanishes, if the vectors are either parallel or antiparallel.

(v) The self–cross product, i.e., product of a vector with itself is the null vector In physics the null vector 0 is simply denoted as zero.

(vi) The self–vector products of unit vectors are thus zero.

(vii) In the case of orthogonal unit vectors, ,̂ , ˆˆ_i j k_, in accordance with the right hand screw rule: Also, since the cross product is not commutative,

(viii) In terms of components, the vector product of two vectors 

FORMULAS 

Note that in the ĵ _th_ component the order of multiplication is different than ̂ _thi_ and _kth_ˆ components.

(ix) If two vectors _A and B_ form adjacent sides in a parallelogram, then the magnitude of _A × B_ will give the area of the parallelogram as represented graphically in Figure 2.23.
![Alt text](<../fig 2.23.1.png>)
**Figure 2.23 Area of parallelogram**

(x) Since we can divide a parallelogram into two equal triangles as shown in the Figure 2.24, the area of a triangle with _A and B_ as sides is [1 / 2 ]_A × B_. This is shown in the Figure 2.24. (This fact will be used when we study Kepler’s laws in unit 6)

**Figure 2.24 Area of triangle**  

A number of quantities used in Physics are defined through vector products. Particularly physical quantities representing rotational effects like torque, angular momentum, are defined through vector products.

**Examples** 

(i) Torque τ = _r × F_ . where _F_ is Force and _r_ is position vector of a particle

(ii) Angular momentum _L = r × p_ where _p_ is the linear momentum 

(iii) Linear Velocity Formulas ×ω where ω is angular velocity
