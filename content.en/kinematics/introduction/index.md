# INTRODUCTION
Physics is basically an experimental science
and rests on two pillars–Experiments and
mathematics. Two thousand three hundred
years ago the Greek librarian Eratosthenes
measured the radius of the Earth. The size of
the atom was measured much later, only in
the beginning of the 20th century. The central
aspect in physics is motion. Motion is found
at all levels–from microscopic level (within
the atom) to macroscopic and galactic level
(planetary system and beyond). In short
the entire Universe is governed by various
types of motion. The study of various types of motion is expressed using the language of
mathematics.
How do objects move? How fast or slow do
they move? For example, when ten athletes
run in a race, all of them do not run in the
same manner. Their performance cannot be
qualitatively recorded by usage of words like
‘fastest’, ‘faster’, ‘average’, ‘slower’ or ‘slowest’.
It has to be quantified. Quantifying means
assigning numbers to each athlete’s motion.
Comparing these numbers, one can analyse
how fast or slow each athlete runs when
compared to others. In this unit, the basic
mathematics needed for analyzing motion
in terms of its direction and magnitude is
covered.Kinematics is the branch of mechanics
which deals with the motion of objects
without taking force into account. The
Greek word “kinema” means “motion”
