# COMPONENTS OF A VECTOR


In the Cartesian coordinate system any vector _A_ can be resolved into three components along x, y and z directions. This is shown in Figure 2.20.

Consider a 3–dimensional coordinate system. With respect to this a vector can be written in component form as

**Figure 2.20** Components of a vector in 2 dimensions and 3 dimensions

Here _Ax_ is the _x_–component of _A_, _Ay_ is the _y_–component of _A_ and _Az_ is the _z_ component of _A_.

In a 2–dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (which is shown in the Figure 2.20) the vector _A_ is given by
FORMULAS 

If _A_ makes an angle θ with x axis, and Ax and Ay are the components of _A_ along _x_–axis and _y_–axis respectively, then as shown in Figure 2.21,

Ax = A cosθ , Ay_ = Asinθ

where ‘A’ is the magnitude (length) of the vector

**EXAMPLE 2.3**

What are the unit vectors along the negative x–direction, negative y–direction, and negative z– direction?

**_Solution_**

The unit vectors along the negative directions can be shown as in the following figure.

Then we have:The unit vector along the negative x direction = î The unit vector along the negative y direction = ĵ The unit vector along the negative z direction = _k̂_ .

## Vector addition using components

In the previous section we have learnt about addition and subtraction of two vectors using geometric methods. But once we choose a coordinate system, the addition and subtraction of vectors becomes much easier to perform.

The two vectors _A_ and _B_ in a Cartesian coordinate system can be expressed as

FORMULAS

Then the addition of two vectors is equivalent to adding their corresponding x, y and z components.

FORMULAS 

Similarly the subtraction of two vectors is equivalent to subtracting the corresponding x, y and z components.

FORMULAS 

The above rules form an analytical way of adding and subtracting two vectors.

**EXAMPLE 2.4**

Two vectors _A_ and _B_ are given in the component form as 5 7  _A i j k_ and

**Note**
The addition of two vectors using components depends on the choice of the coordinate system. But the geometric way of adding and subtracting two vectors is independent of the coordinate system used.
